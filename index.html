          While not much was seen of his personality, A did seemingly have a
          verbal tic, ending his sentences with "yo" (よ).[5] He also seemed to
          have a habit of folding his arms. He was a prideful man and held the
          idea that shinobi shouldn't lower their heads so easily. A had a
          strong will to protect Kumogakure, something he passed down to his
          successor.

          A was a dark-skinned man, with prominent creases under his eyes and a
          mop of shaggy black hair, which partially obscured his forehead
          protector. In terms of attire, he wore a high-collared dark
          kimono-shirt, dark pants bound by a sash and a light-coloured scarf
          around his neck. He also wore small stud-earrings. In the anime, his
          attire consists of a cream-coloured coat with a high collar, a white
          forehead protector, zōri and a purple scarf around his neck.
